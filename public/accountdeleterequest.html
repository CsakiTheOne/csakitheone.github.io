    <h1>Account deletion</h1>

    <h3>Welcome to my Android app!</h3>

    <p>
        If the application you are using stores any kind of user data, you can delete it.
        The easiest way to do this is from the app itself. In most of my apps, I provide the option to delete your account quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the app has no such an option, you can request your accounts removal via sending an email to jockahun@gmail.com
    </p>

    <p>
        If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding
        how the app protectes your data and privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
    </p>
